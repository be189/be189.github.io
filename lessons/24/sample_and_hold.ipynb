    "## Basic concepts behind transistors\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go into the details of the (Nobel Prize-winning) physics behind how transistors work, but will treat them from practical perspective. Transistors are three-terminal components. They come predominantly in two varieties, **bipolar junction transistors** (BJTs) and **field effect transistors** (FETs). These two varieties of transistor vary in their mode of construction and in other meaningful way in their operation that we will not spend much time on. FETs are dominant in electronics these days, including in the integrated circuits mentioned above, but BJTs are still widely used. Importantly, both varieties have the same two salient features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transistors have a polarity, with one end more positive than the other. \n",
    "2. Charge is carried from one terminal electrode to another under control of a third electrode.\n",
    "3. Transistors are active in the sense that the output signal they can produce is greater than an input (control) signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details of how transistors work is very interesting and worth delving into if you have the time. You can start with the Wikipedia pages for [BJTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor) and [FETs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor)."

    "## Bipolar junction transistors as switches\n",
    "\n",
    "Your kit does not include any FETs, but has both of the two varieties of BJTs, *npn* and *pnp*. Here, \"*n*\" means that the semiconductor is doped to allow electron transport and \"*p*\" means that the semiconductor is doped with holes to accept electrons. The difference in ordering of the layers results in reversed polarities.\n",

    "\n",
    "The labels C, B, and E refer to collector, base, and emitter, respectively. In this exercise, we will use the *npn* BJTs in your kit. They are labeled 2N3904. Do not confuse them with the *pnp* BJTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an *npn*, the current flows from collector through emitter; the collector must be more positive than the emitter. (The opposite is true for a *pnp*.) The current flowing through the collector is approximately $I_C = \\beta I_B$, where $\\beta$ is the gain, typically around 100. (This is an approximation of a result from the Ebers-Moll model.) Note, though, that because the collector must be more positive than the emitter, the transistor reaches **saturation** above a given input current $I_B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the input current is sufficiently high, the transistor operates at saturation and the current through it is set by the resistance of the load (that is the current that would be there if the load was connected to ground and not through the transistor). When the base current is zero, then no current flows through the transistor. In such a way, the transistor can function like a switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless other applications of transistors, especially when used with feedback, but we will just use them as switches. This is not too restrictive; as Horowitz and Hill put it, \"If you took a census, asking all of the transistors of the world what they are doing, at least 95% would tell you they are switches.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask what are the advantages of using transistors versus mechanical switches?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mechanical switches wear out. You can vary the base current of a transistor-based switch over and over again and it does not wear out.\n",
    "2. Mechanical switches are slow. You can switch a transistor with sub-microsecond speed. This is not possible for mechanical switches.\n",
    "3. Transistor-based switches can be controlled/triggered by output from other circuits. This also means they can be controlled from a computer.\n",

The emitter is grounded, which serves to ground the circuit, including the LED. The base of the transistor is controlled by digital output from the Arduino Uno. We are using a 10 kÎ© resistor on this input, giving a current of about 500 nA, which is plenty for the transistor to be operating at saturation.\n",

    "1. I allow for input signals to be both single bytes representing an integer, like `1`, `2`, or `3`, but for the same signal to be sent as ASCII text. In ASCII, `1` is character number 49, so if I type `1` as input in the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE, Arduino will read it in at bytes representing the number 49. Writing the code in this way facilitates me controlling the Arduino from the Serial Monitor or from Python.\n",
    "2. I use `led1PinState = !ledPin1State` to toggle the state of the LED. Thus, each time I enter `2`, for example, LED 2 gets turned on or off.\n",
    "3. To switch the LED on, we send a signal using Arduino's digital pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the circuit and uploading the sketch, either control which LEDs are on (and showing the oscillating illumination) via widgets on a dashboard or by hand-entering the numbers in the Serial Monitor. You will see that the transistors act as a switch, sending the input voltage across the LED when on and blocking it while off.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler way to make the LEDs flash on and off sinusoidally would be to use PWM directly from the digital pins of the Arduino. There is no need for transistors in that case. However, if we want to have an analog input to the LEDs, and we only have one DAC, the transistors make it possible to switch them on and off.\n",
