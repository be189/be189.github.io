Instead, most electrical circuits are drawn as **schematics**. They are more abstract than the **pictorial representation** above and are easier to create.\n",

    "There are many computer programs available for drawing schematics. You will need to do so in your some of your exercises and definitely in your projects. I think it is also useful to show pictorial representations as well. To draw both of these, [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) is a valuable and widely used tool. It is possible to get it for free, but if you have the means, I could encourage you to make the suggested donation (â‚¬8). Fritzing is fairly self-explanatory to use."
