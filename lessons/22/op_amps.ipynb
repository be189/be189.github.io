    "## Op-amps with feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "An op-amp is an active (meaning externally powered with a DC power source) integrated circuit that has two inputs and one output. The *difference* between the two inputs is amplified with very high gain. Because of the high gain op-amps are almost always used with feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Op-amps are powered by a positive and negative voltage source, $V_+$ and $V_-$, with $V_- = -V_+$. Because it requires negative voltage, we cannot use the Arduino Uno to power the op-amp, but need an external power supply. The Digilent PowerBRICKs in your kit provide this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few \"rules\" to keep in mind about op-amps used in feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The gain is huge (typically $10^5$-$10^6$).\n",
    "2. The inputs draw very small current (typically of order picoamps).\n",
    "3. The output tends to make the voltage difference zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule (3) follows from rules (1) and (2), which we demonstrate below. To quickly think about op-amps, it is useful to keep these rules of thumb in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply op-amps to active filters, such as [Sallen-Key filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen–Key_topology), in the next lesson. For now, we will explore the use of an op-amp in a non-inverting amplifier, which is simpler to analyze, and the analysis provides insight."

    "Note that we have labeled a point $a$ in the circuit as a reference for our analysis. The symbol for an op-amp is a triangle with two inputs and a single output. The op-amp amplifies the difference between the input labeled with a \"+\" (referred to as the noninverting input) and that labeled with a \"–\" (referred to as the inverting input). Play close attention when looking at a schematic; the inverting input can be on top or bottom. In some schematics, the power supplies ($V_+$ and $V_-$) for the op-amp are also included, given as vertical connections on the slanted sides of the triangle. In many schematics, including this one, we do not explicitly show those and note that they are in fact there.\n",

    "Thinking intuitively about the circuit, imagine $V_\\mathrm{in}$ goes up. Remembering rule 3 above, if $V_\\mathrm{in}$ goes up, the output will be adjusted so that $V_\\mathrm{a}$ also goes up in order to drive the difference between the inputs to the op-amp to be close to zero. In order to get $V_a$ to go  up, $V_\\mathrm{out}$ must also go up. Similarly, if $V_\\mathrm{in}$ goes down, so too does $V_\\mathrm{out}$.\n",

This is the beauty of op-amps. The nature of the amplification is entirely dependent on what circuit you put in the feedback and independent of the details of the op-amp itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this only works within a given range of input and output voltages. The maximum $V_\\mathrm{out}$ for any op-amp is $V_+$ and the minimum $V_\\mathrm{out}$ is $V_-$. In between these boundaries, good op-amps give amplification that is independent of $V_+$ and $V_-$."
