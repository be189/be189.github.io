    "## Op-amps with feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "An op-amp is an active (meaning externally powered with a DC power source) integrated circuit that has two inputs and one output. The *difference* between the two inputs is amplified with very high gain. Because of the high gain op-amps are almost always used with feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Op-amps are powered by a positive and negative voltage source, $V_+$ and $V_-$, with $V_- = -V_+$. Because it requires negative voltage, we cannot use the Arduino Uno to power the op-amp, but need an external power supply. The Digilent PowerBRICKs in your kit can serve as a good power supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few \"rules\" to keep in mind about op-amps used in feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The gain is huge (typically $10^5$-$10^6$).\n",
    "2. The inputs draw very small current (typically of order picoamps).\n",
    "3. The output tends to make the voltage difference zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "More detail on rule 3, as per Yang:\n",
    "The output will \"rail\" (go to the max or min voltage) unless the difference between the inputs is very small. By putting an op-amp in a negative feedback configuration, we let the output control one of the inputs. This way, the output will settle at a non-\"rail\" voltage while keeping the input difference effectively at zero.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule (3) follows from rules (1) and (2), which we demonstrate below. To quickly think about op-amps, it is useful to keep these rules of thumb in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply op-amps to active filters, such as [Sallen-Key filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen–Key_topology), in the next lesson. For now, we will explore the use of an op-amp in a non-inverting amplifier, which is simpler to analyze, and the analysis provides insight."

Pay close attention when looking at a schematic; the inverting input can be on top or bottom. In some schematics, the power supplies ($V_+$ and $V_-$) for the op-amp are also included, given as vertical connections on the slanted sides of the triangle. In many schematics, including this one, we do not explicitly show those and note that they are in fact there.\n",
