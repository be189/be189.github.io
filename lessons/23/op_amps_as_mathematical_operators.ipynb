    "When designing circuits, we often want to add voltages. A common example is when we use a high pass filter applied to a signal and the DC signal is attenuated to close to zero so that the filtered signal dips into negative voltages. If we have a detector that can only read nonnegative voltages (such as the built-in ADC of Arduino Uno), we will not be able to read our filtered signal. So, we may wish to add an offset voltage to the filtered signal to bring it above zero (e.g., if the *variation* of the signal is what we are interested in).\n",
