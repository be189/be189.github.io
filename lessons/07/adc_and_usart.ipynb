    "A sensor converts an external signal to an analog voltage. This voltage needs to be converted to a digital value by [analog to digital conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter) (ADC). The ATmega328 microcontroller has a built-in 10-bit ADC. That means that an analog voltage value gets converted to a 10-bit unsigned integer. Voltages in Arduino range from 0 to 5V, so there is a mapping between the input voltage and the value given by the ADC. If *v* is the analog input voltage, then the ADC will give an integer between 0 and 1023 according to\n",

This is a form of [serial communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication). In serial communication, data is sent single-file, bit-by-bit. All of Arduino's serial communication protocols (I2C, SPI, 1-wire, and USART) are serial. We will discuss and use I2C in a forthcoming lesson; here we focus on USART.\n",

    "The Serial library is included in the core Arduino libraries and is included in [the language reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/). Many functions are available in the library, and we will focus here on sending data to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you use serial communication with your computer, you need to open the connection. This is typically done in the `setup()` function. The syntax is\n",
    "\n",
    "```arduino\n",
    "Serial.begin(115200);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument of the `Serial.begin()` function is the **baud rate**, which is the number of bits per second you want to send over serial. According to the [ATmega328 data sheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) (see the tables at the end of section 19), you can achieve baud rates up to 2 million bits per second. Serial communication relies on clock timing to work, so commonly used baud rates are in sync with clock operating frequencies. The most commonly used baud rates are 9600 and 115,200. We will usually use a baud rate of 115,200. **The baud rate setting for whatever software you are using on your computer to receive a serial transmission must be the same as the baud rate you set in your sketch.** If the baud rates are different, you will receive jibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "As [described in the docs](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/begin/), in addition to setting the baud rate, you can also set the configuration for the transmission of bytes. By default, the Serial library used [8N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-N-1). This means that a \"byte\" that is transmitted consists of eight bits, no parity bits, and one stop bit. This is a standard configuration and is the default for the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor and for PySerial, the package we will use in Python to receive serial data. It is a standard configuration and there is no need to change it for this class. It does mean that for every byte you wish to transfer, 10 bits are transferred: one start bit, eight bits of data, and one stop bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serial communications are done in bytes as defined by the configuration. In our case, it will be 8N1.\n",
    "The `Serial.write()` function is a low-level function for sending bytes as binary data. This can result in greater speed, but it requires careful coordination with your computer so that it knows which bits correspond to which values. For example, if each data packet has two 16 bit integers, 40 total bits are transmitted, and your computer needs to be programmed to know what the bits mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher-level functions `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` provide serial communication that is much easier to parse on the receiving end. These functions send all data over USB *as text*. That is, if I want to send the number 27, it is sent not as its binary representation `00011011`, but rather as [ASCII text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). In this case, \"27\" is sent as two bytes, `00110010` and `00110111`, which give the numbers 50 and 55, which are the ASCII codes for the *characters* \"2\" and \"7\". So, to transmit the number 27, you are using twice as many bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the ease of parsing strings, say you wanted to send two 10-bit unsigned integers taken from calls to `analogRead()`, say 51 and 981. You could \"waste\" the extra data that you have to send over USB to make it a nicely formatted comma-separated string, `\"51,981\\n\"`, where `\\n` is the newline character marking the end of the transmission. Having the newline character is useful because you can tell Python, for example, to read until you hit the newline character, thereby ensuring you get a full record. If you are using Python to read in the data from USB (you will learn how to do that in coming lessons), the string is easily parsed, e.g., into a list of two integers using Python's powerful string methods."

    "\n",
    "**a)** We will assume an 8N1 protocol. Let's assume that we want to include the time stamp in microseconds and also a single voltage value from ADC. We'll assume we have at best a 16-bit ADC and at worst a 10-bit ADC, so we'll need to transmit two bytes either way for the voltage value. (We are not actually transmitting the voltage value, but an integer that can be converted to a voltage value.) The time stamp, being in microseconds is an `unsigned long`, which means it is a 32-bit integer. If we do a reading for an hour, we will get to 10-digit numbers for the time stamps. Assuming we transmit each pair of data as a comma separated string, like `\"3600000000,55231\\n\"`, we are sending 17 characters for a total of 170 bits per reading. We have to send those every 40 µs, or 25,000 transmissions per second. At 170 bits each, this is 4.25 million bits per second. This is faster than the ATmega328's maximum baud rate of 2 million bits per second.\n",

    "If, however, we assume we get the timing right, and we only receive the voltage values, like `\"55231\\n\"`, we receive six characters per transmission, or 60 bits, which is 1.5 million bits per second, within the baud rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we chose instead to transmit the time and voltage in binary, the time is an unsigned long, so 40 total bits would be transmitted for it. The voltage is a 16-bit integer, so 20 bits are transmitted. We're again at 60 bits per transmission, which is within the limits of baud rate of the Arduino.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if we only transmitted the voltage and not the time in binary, we transmit 20 bits per transmission, which is 500,000 bits per second, well within the capabilities of the ATmega328.\n",

    "**b)** Low-end solid state drives have a write speeds above 300 MB per second. This is far faster than the baud rate, so writing to disk is no problem.\n",
