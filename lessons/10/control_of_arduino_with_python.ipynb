We will send a byte instructing Arduino to turn the LED on, a byte to turn the LED off, and also a byte for **handshaking**. When first connecting with Arduino, it is good to send a byte and receive a byte to make sure everything is working ok; this is called handshaking. In my sketches, I always have `0` be a handshaking byte, and I have Arduino respond with a string, `\"Message received.\"`.\n",

    "- We next have a set of conditionals that determine what Arduino will do, depending on what byte was sent. If the sent byte does not match any of those specified by the global variables, it is ignored.\n",
    "- When we check for handshaking, we check to make sure the write buffer is not full. The `Serial.availableForWrite()` function returns the number of bytes in the write buffer (out of the total of 64) that are available for writing. We then proceed to write the handshake message.\n",
