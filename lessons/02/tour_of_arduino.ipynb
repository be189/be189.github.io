All of the terminals along the red line are connected to each other. All of those along the blue line are also connected to each other. In both cases, that is all they are connected to. So, if you want to proved power to components, you connect a voltage source to one of the terminals of the red strip, and all of the terminals on the strip are then connected to the voltage source. Similarly, if you connect one of the terminals in the blue strip to ground, then all of the terminals in the blue strip are connected to ground\n",

You will notice based on the markings of the breadboard that each terminal as a unique letter-number address. `a1` is the terminal on the top right of the image and `j64` is at the bottom left. the terminals are connected as follows. `a#`, `b#`, `c#`, `d#`, and `e#`, where `#` denotes a number (e.g., `17`), are connected. `f#`, `g#`, `h#`, `i#`, and `j#`, are also connected. There is no other connections.

The jack fits a 2.1mm DC Plug, and any DC power supply between 6 and 20 V may be used, but between 7 and 12 V is recommended. You will most likely not use this input, since you will almost always have your computer connected via the USB port, which also supplies power.\n",

    "- **USB interface chip**: This chip does the calculations and data conversions necessary for communication via USB with external devices (almost always your computer). The maximum supported baud rate for sending and receiving data over USB is 115,200 baud (1 baud = 1 bit/second).\n",
    "- **USB port**: This is where you insert the \"B\" end of the USB cable you will you to connect your computer to the Arduino Uno.

    "To program an Arduino, you write Arduino-flavored C++ code, called a \"sketch,\" on your computer using the Arduino IDE, and then that code is compiled using ARV-GCC, a compile specific to microcontrollers made by the company that makes the ATmega328. The compiler is included in the Arduino IDE. The compiled objects are uploaded onto the ATmega328 microcontroller. The program is then run on the board.\n",

    "- **An 8-bit central processing unit (CPU).** It is capable of performing about 20 million instructions per second.\n",
    "- **2 kB of static random access memory (SRAM).** This is the RAM that is utilized when running your sketch.\n",
    "- **32 kB of flash memory (also called program memory).** This is where the compiled program code is stored. Also stored in flash memory is the **bootloader**, which is what allows changes to the flash memory. You can write to flash memory if you know how, but for now, don't even think about it. There are many ways that can go wrong and brick your Arduino.\n",
    "- **1 kB of electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM).** This is kind of like a hard disk. It is memory that code running on the microcontroller can read from and write to. Unlike SRAM, but like flash memory, data stored in EEPROM persists even when the Arduino is powered down. EEPROM is usually used to store configuration information. We generally will not use EEPROM, opting instead to send data via USB to the computer and store it there.\n",
    "- **23 general purpose input/output ports.** This allows the microcontroller to read in voltages from pins on the Arduino as well as write voltages to those pins.\n",
    "- **A universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter (USART).** This takes bits of data and communicates them (either reading or writing) serially. The USART connects with the USB interface chip to communicate serially over USB with your computer.\n",
    "- **An inter-integrated circuit (I2C or I²C) interface.** This two-wire interface also communication with peripheral devices. The default for data communication is 100 kbaud (100,000 bits per second), but this can be increased to 400 kbaud. The acronym is either pronounced \"I-squared-C\" or \"I-two-C.\" I2C communication will be discussed later in this lesson.\n",
    "- **A serial peripheral interface (SPI) port.** This is used to communicate with peripheral devices and requires four wires. It is significantly faster than I2C, achieving about 15 Mbaud (15 million bits per second) on Arduino. SPI communication will be discussed later in this lesson.\n",
    "- **A six-channel 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC).** When an analog signal comes it, e.g., a voltage, it needs to be converted into digital data to be stored. The 10-bit converter converts a voltage between zero and five volts to a 10-bit integer (that is, an integer between 0 and 1023). The ADC on the ATmega328 can accept signal from six channels. Each conversion of an analog voltage to a digital number takes about 110 µs, but this can be reduced about ten-fold with some trickery involving the clock.\n",
