    "The symbol at the bottom with three lines indicates ground. For now, you can consider the two generic impedances, Z₁ and Z₂, to be resistances; that is, you can think of the two boxes as resistors with resistance R₁ and R₂. The question is how does $V_\\mathrm{out}$ compare to $V_\\mathrm{in}$. We can derive this from three key properties of circuits. First, Ohm's law, which says that $V = I R$, where $V$ is a voltage, $I$ is a current, and $R$ is a resistance. Second, resistors in series add. Third, the current in to any point in a circuit is equal to the current out of it. This third rule means that in the circuit above, the current is the same everywhere. There is a voltage of $V_\\mathrm{out}$ across R₂ and a voltage of $V_\\mathrm{in}$ across R₁ and R₂. Thus,\n",

To do so, make sure you plug the red lead of your multimeter into the 500 mA port (the center one on the WeePro), and the black one on the COM port. Turn the dial to 20V DC (roughly at 10 o'clock on the dial). To measure the input voltage, touch the multimeter leads to the positive lead of R₃ and the negative lead of R₄.
