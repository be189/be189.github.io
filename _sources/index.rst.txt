BE/EE/MedE 189 a: Design and Construction of Biodevices
===============================================================

Novel measurements often require novel instruments. In this course, you will learn how to build your own instruments using an `Arduino platform <https://www.arduino.cc>`_. You will first learn basic principles of prototyping electronic instruments and will ultimately build, construct, test, and use a spectrophotometer and a pulse oximeter. While these are not "new" instruments, the skills developed here will transfer to design and construction of your own biodevices in the future.
