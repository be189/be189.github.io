Introduction to CAD & 3D Printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Computer Aided Design (CAD)
...........................

Many professionals use CAD in a wide variety of industries, from
product design/engineering to architecture. Many tools and softwares
exist to help us CAD, most of which cost money to use. Here are a few
free tools by Autodesk you can use to start designing your own CAD
models. Autodesk offers `educational
licenses <https://www.autodesk.com/education/students>`_ to students,
and that allows you to use most of their products for free as long as
you are in school.

* `TinkerCAD (browser only) <https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard>`_
* `Autodesk Fusion (Click 'Fusion' from this page, choose either
  browser or download)
  <https://www.autodesk.com/education/gateway?sorting=featured&filters=individual>`_
* `AutoCAD (Separate download links for Windows, Mac, and browser on
  the page)
  <https://www.autodesk.com/education/gateway?sorting=featured&filters=individual>`_
* Additionally, `Solidworks <http://www.solidworks.com/>`_, which
  you've probably heard of, is available through the Caltech Software
  Store

Out of the three tools, TinkerCAD is the easiest and fastest way to
get started with CAD, as the design features are not as comprehensive
as the other two and there are many pre-made models in TinkerCAD that
you can use for your own designs. There are many free YouTube
tutorials for all tools. For TinkerCAD, `this short video
<https://youtu.be/ZvDkf1CEpMY?si=GHH23F2LZCZl2PKb>`_ covers all of the
features you need to know and will be sufficient for making custom
parts for the class. But if you start feeling like TinkerCAD is too
restrictive, it may be time for you to move to Fusion or AutoCAD!

Printing your model
...................

Once you have a 3D model you're satisfied with, the next step is to
export the model so you can 3D-print it. For `FDM printers
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication>`_, the
model needs to be sliced into very thin horizontal slices so that the
printer can print each layer at a time, from bottom up. There are
tools called "slicers" that will read a 3D model, slice it into
layers, and translate that into a language called "g-code" that
printers can read.

First, you'll want to export your 3D model into either an .stl or .obj
file. You'll need to know in advance what printer you will work
with. At TechLab (first floor of Caltech Hall), they have CraftUnique
Craftbot Plus printers.

Next, we bring the .stl or .obj file into a slicer software like these:

* `Ultimaker Cura <https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software>`_
* `Slic3r <http://slic3r.org/>`_
* `Simplify3D <https://www.simplify3d.com/>`_ which is paid but is
  available for use at TechLab

When you use a slicer, you will need to state what printer you will
use. You may be able to find presets for the printer, or set up a
custom profile for the printer. For Ultimaker Cura, watch `this video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDdiCBENvNk>`_ to set up a custom
profile for the TechLab CraftBot printers.

Almost all FDM printers will have these parameters, which will most
likely be included in the printer profile:

* Bed temperature: the printer bed is usually heated (so don't touch
  it with your hands, obviously) to make sure your print doesn't move
  around as the printer nozzle moves over it to deposit more
  material. If your bed temperature is too low, the print won't adhere
  to the bed very easily and you can end up with a
  spaghetti-monster-looking blob instead of your print, or get bad
  warping on your prints. If your bed temperature is too high, then
  you can end up with an elephant's foot, which refers to when your
  lower print layers spread outwards.
* Nozzle/Extruder temperature: the nozzle (a.k.a extruder) is made of
  metal that can heat up to temperatures that can melt the print
  material. Needless to say, nozzle temperature depends on the
  material you're printing with. For PLA, it's 180-220 celsius, and
  for ABS, it's 240-290 celsius. You can adjust the nozzle temperature
  within a narrow range around the optimal temperature for a material,
  as higher temperatures usually give a glossy finish and lower
  temperatures a more matte finish to your prints. Printing outside
  the optimal temperature range can lead to print quality issues.
* Nozzle size: the most standard size for nozzles is 0.4 mm. Smaller
  nozzles are better for fine details, while larger nozzles can
  deposit more material at once, which makes printing faster. Some
  materials, like carbon or metals, will need larger nozzles than
  plastics like PLA and ABS.

Load your model into the slicer. You can rotate or translate the model
to wherever on the print bed. You can even print multiple models at
the same time. There are a few parameters you can tweak on the
slicer. Some of them are:

* Dimensions of the model: will your model fit on the printer bed?
* Supports: for any part of your model that is floating (not attached
  to the printer bed) there will need to be supports from the printer
  bed to that part of your model (essentially extra plastic that will
  hold up your model). Supports add material and time to your print,
  so make sure you design your model with minimal floating structures,
  and orient your model such that most of your model is laying on the
  print bed to minimize the need for supports.
* Infill: how solid do you want your prints to be? A good place to
  start is 20%, meaning that inside the walls of your model, the
  object will be 20% full with material.

Save the .gcode output to a USB drive, and you're ready to print!

are slides I put together a couple of years ago for 3D
printing. Please feel free to take a look!
