Wiring hygiene can be challenge when working with a solderless breadboard and the numerous power supplies bricks, i2C devices, 
and sensors used in the final prrojects.  To eliviate some of these challenges, BE189 alumni Ethan Labelson and your lowly instructor
have designed a board (the BE189 Shield) that interface directly with your Uno R3.  The shield can be diffuclt to remove from the Uno R3
once installed, ask you instructor or the TAs for assistance.
